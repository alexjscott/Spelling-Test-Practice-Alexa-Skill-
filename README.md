# Spelling Test Practice (Alexa Skill)
My second year, University group project .

## Overview of the Project
Children around the world are practicing spellings for spelling tests. Parents around the world are trying to find time to help their children. This application will help pupils practice their spelling for the week.  

## Constraints
â€¢	Developed as an Amazon Alexa skill so that it can run on Echo devices

## Requirements
Features will be discussed and agreed before and during the project. Here are some initial ideas for features that could be included:
1.	Parents can set the words that need to be practiced that week
2.	The child can request that the words be read out, one at a time to practice
3.	Alexa will read out the spellings so the child can confirm
4.	Child can tell Alexa whether they got the spelling correct. Then Alexa can test the pupil on the words they get incorrect most often.
